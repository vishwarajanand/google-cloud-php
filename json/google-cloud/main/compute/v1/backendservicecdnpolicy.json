This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience by reducing response latency. When the cache mode is set to CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to responses with the specified response code that lack any Cache-Control, Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses with the specified response code, and override any caching headers. By default, Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes: HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s. These defaults can be overridden in negative_caching_policy.<\/p>\n","types":["<a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/language.types.boolean.php\" target=\"_blank\">bool<\/a>"],"optional":false,"nullable":null}],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["<a data-custom-type=\"compute\/v1\/backendservicecdnpolicy\">Google\\Cloud\\Compute\\V1\\BackendServiceCdnPolicy<\/a>"],"description":""}]},{"id":"getNegativeCachingPolicy","type":"instance","name":"getNegativeCachingPolicy","source":"Compute\/src\/V1\/BackendServiceCdnPolicy.php#L380","description":"<p>Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status code. negative_caching must be enabled to configure negative_caching_policy.
