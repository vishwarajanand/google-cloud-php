{"id":"compute\/v1\/policy","type":"","title":"Google\\Cloud\\Compute\\V1\\Policy","name":"Policy","description":"<p>An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A <code>Policy<\/code> is a collection of <code>bindings<\/code>. A <code>binding<\/code> binds one or more <code>members<\/code>, or principals, to a single <code>role<\/code>. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A <code>role<\/code> is a named list of permissions; each <code>role<\/code> can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a <code>binding<\/code> can also specify a <code>condition<\/code>, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to <code>true<\/code>. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/iam\/help\/conditions\/resource-policies\">IAM documentation<\/a>. <strong>JSON example:<\/strong> { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles\/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike&#64;example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins&#64;example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id&#64;appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles\/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve&#64;example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } <strong>YAML example:<\/strong> bindings: - members: - user:mike&#64;example.com - group:admins&#64;example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id&#64;appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles\/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve&#64;example.com role: roles\/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/iam\/docs\/\">IAM documentation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Generated from protobuf message <code>google.cloud.compute.v1.Policy<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Extends <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/protocolbuffers\/protobuf-php\/tree\/v3.21.9\/src\/Google\/Protobuf\/Internal\/Message.php\" target=\"_blank\">Google\\Protobuf\\Internal\\Message<\/a><\/p>","examples":[],"resources":[],"methods":[{"id":"__construct","type":"constructor","name":"__construct","source":"Compute\/src\/V1\/Policy.php#L72","description":"<p>Constructor.<\/p>","examples":[],"resources":[],"params":[{"name":"data","description":"<p>Optional.
