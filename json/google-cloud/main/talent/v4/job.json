And when creating a job with past timestamp, the\n[posting_publish_time][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.posting_publish_time] must be set before\n[posting_expire_time][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.posting_expire_time]. The purpose of this feature is\nto allow other objects, such as [Application][], to refer a job\nthat didn't exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you\nwant to modify a job that was expired on creation,\ndelete it and create a new one.\nIf this value isn't provided at the time of job creation or is invalid,\nthe job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For\nexample, if the job was created on 2017\/01\/01 13:00AM UTC with an\nunspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017\/01\/31 13:00AM UTC.\nIf this value isn't provided on job update, it depends on the field masks\nset by [UpdateJobRequest.update_mask][google.cloud.talent.v4.UpdateJobRequest.update_mask]. If the field masks include\n[job_end_time][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.job_end_time], or the masks are empty meaning that every field is\nupdated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last\nupdate time. Otherwise the expiration date isn't updated.<\/p>\n","types":["<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/protocolbuffers\/protobuf-php\/tree\/v3.21.9\/src\/Google\/Protobuf\/Timestamp.php\" target=\"_blank\">Google\\Protobuf\\Timestamp<\/a>"],"optional":false,"nullable":null}],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["<a data-custom-type=\"talent\/v4\/job\">Google\\Cloud\\Talent\\V4\\Job<\/a>"],"description":""}]},{"id":"getPostingCreateTime","type":"instance","name":"getPostingCreateTime","source":"Talent\/src\/V4\/Job.php#L1507","description":"<p>Output only.
