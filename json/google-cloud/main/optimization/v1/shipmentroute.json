Though time intervals can sometimes have zero duration, i.e. start\nand end at the same second, they often have a positive duration.\nInvariants:<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If there are n visits, there are n+1 transitions.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>A visit is always surrounded by a transition before it (same index) and a\ntransition after it (index + 1).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>The vehicle start is always followed by transition #0.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>The vehicle end is always preceded by transition #n.\nZooming in, here is what happens during a <code>Transition<\/code> and a <code>Visit<\/code>:<\/p>\n<pre><code>---+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+--&gt;\n|           TRANSITION[i]             |           VISIT[i]          |\n|                                     |                             |\n|  * TRAVEL: the vehicle moves from   |      PERFORM the visit:     |\n|    VISIT[i-1].departure_location to |                             |\n|    VISIT[i].arrival_location, which |  * Spend some time:         |\n|    takes a given travel duration    |    the \"visit duration\".    |\n|    and distance                     |                             |\n|                                     |  * Load or unload           |\n|  * BREAKS: the driver may have      |    some quantities from the |\n|    breaks (e.g. lunch break).       |    vehicle: the \"demand\".   |\n|                                     |                             |\n|  * WAIT: the driver\/vehicle does    |                             |\n|    nothing. This can happen for     |                             |\n|    many reasons, for example when   |                             |\n|    the vehicle reaches the next     |                             |\n|    event's destination before the   |                             |\n|    start of its time window         |                             |\n|                                     |                             |\n|  * DELAY: *right before* the next   |                             |\n|    arrival.

Thus, it suffice to know the\ndelay duration to know its start and end time.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>The BREAKS are contiguous, non-overlapping periods of time. The\nresponse specifies the start time and duration of each break.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>TRAVEL and WAIT are &quot;preemptable&quot;: they can be interrupted several times\nduring this transition. Clients can assume that travel happens &quot;as soon as\npossible&quot; and that &quot;wait&quot; fills the remaining time.\nA (complex) example:<\/p>\n<pre><code>                           TRANSITION[i]\n--++-----+-----------------------------------------------------------++--&gt;\n||     |       |           |       |           |         |         ||\n||  T  |   B   |     T     |       |     B     |         |    D    ||\n||  r  |   r   |     r     |   W   |     r     |    W    |    e    ||\n||  a  |   e   |     a     |   a   |     e     |    a    |    l    ||\n||  v  |   a   |     v     |   i   |     a     |    i    |    a    ||\n||  e  |   k   |     e     |   t   |     k     |    t    |    y    ||\n||  l  |       |     l     |       |           |         |         ||\n||     |       |           |       |           |         |         ||\n--++-----------------------------------------------------------------++--&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Generated from protobuf message <code>google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Extends <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/protocolbuffers\/protobuf-php\/tree\/v3.21.9\/src\/Google\/Protobuf\/Internal\/Message.php\" target=\"_blank\">Google\\Protobuf\\Internal\\Message<\/a><\/p>","examples":[],"resources":[],"methods":[{"id":"__construct","type":"constructor","name":"__construct","source":"Optimization\/src\/V1\/ShipmentRoute.php#L324","description":"<p>Constructor.<\/p>","examples":[],"resources":[],"params":[{"name":"data","description":"<p>Optional.
