{"id":"grafeas\/v1\/attestationnote","type":"","title":"Grafeas\\V1\\AttestationNote","name":"AttestationNote","description":"<p>Note kind that represents a logical attestation &quot;role&quot; or &quot;authority&quot;. For\nexample, an organization might have one <code>Authority<\/code> for &quot;QA&quot; and one for\n&quot;build&quot;. This note is intended to act strictly as a grouping mechanism for\nthe attached occurrences (Attestations). This grouping mechanism also\nprovides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs gate the ability for a principle\nto attach an occurrence to a given note. It also provides a single point of\nlookup to find all attached attestation occurrences, even if they don't all\nlive in the same project.<\/p>\n<p>Generated from protobuf message <code>grafeas.v1.AttestationNote<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Extends <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/protocolbuffers\/protobuf-php\/tree\/v3.21.9\/src\/Google\/Protobuf\/Internal\/Message.php\" target=\"_blank\">Google\\Protobuf\\Internal\\Message<\/a><\/p>","examples":[],"resources":[],"methods":[]}
